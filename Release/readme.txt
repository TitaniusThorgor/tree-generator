TIPS ON USING:
• Increasing the iterations will 'grow' the tree but also increase the poly count
• Each section has help annotations when the mouse is hovered over
• Use the prerule to generate your trunk

TIPS ON REDUCING POLY COUNT:
• Reduce the amount of faces used for a branch under Tree meshing
• Reduce the amount of faces used for leaves by setting leaf bending to 0
• Use a combination of 'G' and 'F' to give height rather than solely 'F'

HOW TO INSTALL:
• Open the dated folder that corresponds to your version of Maya
• Place "TreeGenerator.mll" and "TreeGeneratorGUI.mel" in Maya20XX\bin\plug-ins
• Inside Maya, go to Windows -> Settings/Preferences -> Plugin Manager
• If the plugin isn't showing up in the list, go to browse and select open it
• Once the plugin is installed, make sure "Loaded" is clicked
• Use 'GenerateTree' for a default tree 
• Use 'TreeGenerator' for the GUI in the command window
